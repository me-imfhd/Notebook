# React Hooks


In this lecture, Harkirat explores key aspects of React, starting with React Hooks like **`useEffect`**, **`useMemo`**, **`useCallback`**, and more, providing practical insights into state management and component functionalities. The discussions extend to creating custom hooks for reusable logic. Prop drilling, a common challenge in passing data between components, is addressed, offering effective solutions. The lecture also covers the Context API, a powerful tool for simplified state management across an entire React application.

# Side Effects in React


In the context of React, `side effects` refer to operations or behaviors that occur outside the scope of the typical component rendering process. These can include data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, and other actions that have an impact beyond rendering the user interface.


Thus, "side effects" are the operations outside the usual rendering process, and "hooks," like **`useEffect`**, are mechanisms provided by React to handle these side effects in functional components. The **`useEffect`** hook allows you to incorporate side effects into your components in a clean and organized manner.


# React Hooks


React Hooks are functions that allow functional components in React to have state and lifecycle features that were previously available only in class components. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to enable developers to use state and other React features without writing a class.


Using these hooks, developers can manage state, handle side effects, optimize performance, and create more reusable and readable functional components in React applications. Each hook serves a specific purpose, contributing to a more modular and maintainable codebase.


Some commonly used React Hooks are:


## 1. useState()


`useState` is a React Hook that enables functional components to manage state. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update that value.


Here's an example of how to use `useState`:


```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // Using useState to initialize count state with an initial value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Event handler to increment count
  const increment = () => {
    // Using the setCount function to update the count state
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```


In this example:

1. We import the `useState` function from the 'react' package.
2. Inside the `Counter` component, we use `useState(0)` to initialize the state variable `count` with an initial value of 0.
3. The `count` state and the `setCount` function are destructured from the array returned by `useState`.
4. The `increment` function updates the `count` state by calling `setCount(count + 1)` when the button is clicked.
5. The current value of the `count` state is displayed within a paragraph element.

> The above example helps us understand how `useState` helps manage and update state in functional components, providing a straightforward way to incorporate stateful behavior into React applications.


## 2. useEffect()


`useEffect` is a React Hook used for performing side effects in functional components. It is often used for tasks such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. The `useEffect` hook accepts two arguments: a function that contains the code to execute, and an optional array of dependencies that determines when the effect should run.


Here's an example of how to use `useEffect`:


```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect will run after the component is mounted
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        // Simulating a data fetching operation
        const response = await fetch('<https://api.example.com/data>');
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    // Effect cleanup (will run before unmounting)
    return () => {
      console.log('Component will unmount. Cleanup here.');
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means the effect runs once after mount

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? (
        <p>Data: {data}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Loading data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataFetcher;
```


In this example:

1. We import `useState` and `useEffect` from 'react'.
2. Inside the `DataFetcher` component, we use `useState` to manage the state of the `data` variable.
3. The `useEffect` hook is employed to perform the data fetching operation when the component is mounted. The empty dependency array `[]` ensures that the effect runs only once after the initial render.
4. The `fetchData` function, declared inside the effect, simulates an asynchronous data fetching operation. Upon success, it updates the `data` state.
5. The component returns content based on whether the data has been fetched.

> `useEffect` is a powerful tool for managing side effects in React components, providing a clean way to handle asynchronous operations and component lifecycle events.


## Problem Statement


## 3. useMemo()


`useMemo` is a React Hook that is used to memoize the result of a computation, preventing unnecessary recalculations when the component re-renders. It takes a function (referred to as the "memoized function") and an array of dependencies. The memoized function will only be recomputed when the values in the dependencies array change.


Here's an example of how to use `useMemo`:


```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveCalculation = ({ value }) => {
  const expensiveResult = useMemo(() => {
    // Simulating a computationally expensive operation
    console.log('Calculating expensive result...');
    return value * 2;
  }, [value]); // Dependency array: recalculates when 'value' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Value: {value}</p>
      <p>Expensive Result: {expensiveResult}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const MemoExample = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(5);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="number"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(Number(e.target.value))}
      />
      <ExpensiveCalculation value={inputValue} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MemoExample;
```


In this example:

1. We import `useState` and `useMemo` from 'react'.
2. The `ExpensiveCalculation` component takes a prop `value` and uses `useMemo` to calculate an "expensive" result based on that value.
3. The dependency array `[value]` indicates that the memoized function should be recomputed whenever the `value` prop changes.
4. The `MemoExample` component renders an `input` element and the `ExpensiveCalculation` component. The `value` prop of `ExpensiveCalculation` is set to the current state of `inputValue`.
5. As you type in the input, you'll notice that the expensive result is only recalculated when the input value changes, thanks to `useMemo`.

> `useMemo` is particularly useful when dealing with expensive calculations or when you want to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computations during renders. It's important to use it judiciously, as overusing memoization can lead to increased complexity.


## 4. useCallback()


`useCallback` is a React Hook that is used to memoize a callback function, preventing unnecessary re-creation of the callback on each render. This can be useful when passing callbacks to child components to ensure they don't trigger unnecessary renders.


Here's an example of how to use `useCallback`:


```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendering...');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
};

const CallbackExample = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Regular callback function
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };

  // Memoized callback using useCallback
  const memoizedHandleClick = useCallback(handleClick, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <ChildComponent onClick={memoizedHandleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CallbackExample;
```


In this example:

1. We import `useState` and `useCallback` from 'react'.
2. The `ChildComponent` receives a prop `onClick` and renders a button with that click handler.
3. The `CallbackExample` component maintains a `count` state and has two callback functions: `handleClick` and `memoizedHandleClick`.
4. `handleClick` is a regular callback function that increments the count and logs a message.
5. `memoizedHandleClick` is created using `useCallback`, and its dependency array (`[]`) indicates that it should only be re-created if the component mounts or unmounts.
6. The `ChildComponent` receives the memoized callback (`memoizedHandleClick`) as a prop.
7. As you click the button in the `ChildComponent`, the count increases, and you'll notice that the log statement inside `handleClick` is only printed once, thanks to `useCallback` preventing unnecessary re-creations of the callback.

> Using `useCallback` becomes more crucial when dealing with complex components or components with frequent re-renders, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary function creations.


## Difference between useEffect, useMemo & useCallback

1. **`useEffect`****:**
	- **Purpose:** Manages side effects in function components.
	- **Triggers:** Runs after rendering and on subsequent re-renders.
	- **Use Cases:** Fetching data, subscriptions, manually changing the DOM, etc.
	- **Syntax:**

		```javascript
		useEffect(() => {
		  // Side effect logic here
		  return () => {
		    // Cleanup logic (optional)
		  };
		}, [dependencies]);
		```

1. **`useMemo`****:**
	- **Purpose:** Memoizes the result of a computation to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
	- **Triggers:** Runs during rendering.
	- **Use Cases:** Memoizing expensive calculations, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
	- **Syntax:**

		```javascript
		const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
		```

1. **`useCallback`****:**
	- **Purpose:** Memoizes a callback function to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.
	- **Triggers:** Runs during rendering.
	- **Use Cases:** Preventing unnecessary re-renders when passing callbacks to child components.
	- **Syntax:**

		```javascript
		const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
		  // Callback logic here
		}, [dependencies]);
		```


> In summary, `useEffect` is for handling side effects, `useMemo` is for memoizing values, and `useCallback` is for memoizing callback functions. Each serves a different purpose in optimizing and managing the behavior of React components.
