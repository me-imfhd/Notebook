# Use nodemon to auto restart


Nodemon is a utility that monitors for changes in your source code and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected. To use Nodemon, you'll need to install it globally or locally in your project, and then you can start your server with Nodemon.


### To install nodemon globally


```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```


### To install locally in project


```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon 
```


### **Use Nodemon to Start Your Server**


```bash
nodemon server.js
```

- With Nodemon, you can focus on your code, and the tool will take care of restarting your server whenever you make changes, making the development process smoother.
