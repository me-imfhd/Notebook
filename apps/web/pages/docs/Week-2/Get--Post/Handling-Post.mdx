# How to handle POST request


When building web applications, it's common to use HTTP POST requests to send data from the client (e.g., a form submission) to the server. In Express.js, handling POST requests involves using middleware to parse the incoming data and defining route handlers to process the data accordingly.


## **Middleware for Parsing JSON and Form Data:**


Before handling POST requests, it's important to include middleware to parse the incoming data. Express provides built-in middleware for handling JSON and form data. Add the following middleware to your Express app:


```javascript
// Middleware to parse JSON and form data
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```


## **Handling a POST Request:**


```javascript
// In-memory array to store text content
const textContent = [];

// Route to handle POST requests for adding text content
app.post('/add-content', (req, res) => {
  // Extract text content from the request body
  const newContent = req.body.content;

  // Validate the content (you might want to add more robust validation)
  if (!newContent) {
		// if there is an error it will send the code 400 and an error
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Content is required' });
  }

  // Add the content to the in-memory array
  textContent.push(newContent);

  // Respond with a success message
  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Content added successfully' });
});
```
