# Todo Application


Up until now, our discussions have primarily revolved around theoretical concepts. In this lecture, Harkirat takes a `practical approach` by guiding us through the hands-on process of `building a to-do application.` We'll be applying the knowledge we've gained so far, specifically focusing on implementing the frontend using `React` and the backend using `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, and `Express` — creating a classic `MERN` stack application.
