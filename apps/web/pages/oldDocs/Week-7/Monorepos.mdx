## Monorepos


---


**Mono** stands for ‚Äú_single_‚Äù and **repo** is short of ‚Äú_repository_‚Äù. When we put codebase of Web App, Mobile App and Backend Server all in single repository/folder. It is called **Monorepo**.


> üí° Monorepo - Multiple apps in one repository.

## Why modules/packages ?


---

- Re-usable code
- Isolation/Separation of concern
- Teams can work on modules independently

## Zod


---


`Zod` - A library to perform backend and frontend validation. 


To perform frontend validation, we use `Zod Inference`, which is automatically creates ‚Äútype‚Äù out of Zod Object.


```typescript
// Creating Zod Object - Using this we can do the backend validation.
const signupInput = z.object({
	username: z.string(),
	password: z.string()
})
```


```typescript
// Creating type out of object for frontend validation
type signupParams = z.infer<typeof signupInput>;



```


```typescript
// Similar to this
type signupParams = {
	username : string,
	password : string
}
```


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Every folder (like in class these were common, client, server) must have package.json and tsconfig.

<details>
<summary>Why can‚Äôt we directly import the file from common ?</summary>

On compilation typescript, complains file is outside of `src` folder.


</details>


## Publish NPM Package


---


> üî• Pre Monorepo era, we publish the package to npm and then npm install. There wasn‚Äôt intercommunication of packages.


Commands used

- `npm login`
- `npm publish --access=publish`
- `npm pack` ‚Äì Creates a zip file of what is going to be published.
- `.npmignore` ‚Äì To avoid publishing some folders.
- `npm version major/minor/patch` ‚Äì This is a pretty cool thing, Read Semantic Versioning.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You can‚Äôt publish over the previous, version.


As mentioned, it is not the good practice to ship complete typescript code. But to reuse/use package we need the ‚Äú_types declaration_‚Äù. So we have `d.ts` file, which can be generated adding `declaration: true` in tsconfig.


> üí° `.d.ts`  = No JavaScript Logic code, only ‚Äú_types declaration_‚Äù


## Mono Repos


---


Publishing the package to `npm` and then importing it. Sucks !! It is complete ugly way. So we have Mono Repos, again, to make our life easier.


Three workarounds to handle the mono repos, in better way.

- `turborepo` : The most popular build system for JS and TS codebases. This jargon is good.
- `lerna` :
- `npm workspaces` :

**The answer you are looking for** üëáüèª


If you are thinking, why are we making this all complex and overwhelming. It is not, it simply looks.

So far the application you have built/thought is `todo`, people working on it is `only you`, and number of users is `1`. But real life applications are opposite, they are `complex`, a `team works`, a `million` users. When developers were in the way of it, there were problems and this is the solution.

If you carefully see, these are just a bunch of folders and files here and there. Just to manage code.
