## Authentication


---


**Tokens**


Before a server sends a response for a request, it must validate if the user is the authentic. Like before accessing your Gmail, it must validate/authenticate that it is you only. 


The key thing to note is the server has to validate/authenticate it for every request.


One way is sending password and email every time with request, which is tedious & stupid, Another way is **tokens**, similar to tokens in metro.


It works like when you `login` successfully, server gives you a token and whenever something is requested, the token is sent along and server authenticates, that yes it is you only.

**Encryption :** way to scramble data so that only authorized parties can unscramble it.

1. **Reversible** : If you have key.

> üí° Think of this as converting the string into non-readable format using a key, and can only be converted into readable format if you have that key.


**Hashing** : Converting a string into a fixed length string.

1. **One-Way Process**/**Irreversible** : Can‚Äôt get `Fox` from the output
2. **A small change is a Big Change** : A little change in the input will result in a significantly different hash value.

> üí° A machine that gives the exact same output for the exact same input. A slight change, even if capital letter to small, output will drastically change.


## Authentication ‚Äì Coding


---

1. Install library `jsonwebtoken`
2. Import `const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');`
3. Create a `secret key` any random string like `const secretKey = "madhav‚Äù`
4. To generate a token `jwt.sign(payload, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' })`
5. To verify or reverse `jwt.verify( token, secretKey, callback)`

```javascript
const authenticateJwt = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;

  if (authHeader) {
    const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1];

    jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, user) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.sendStatus(403);
      }

      req.user = user;
      next();
    });
  } else {
    res.sendStatus(401);
  }
};
```


## Database


---



Since, **storing data in memory** lasts only as long as the application is running, and **storing data in files** is inefficient, slow and require a lot of code for reading and writing. That's why we have a dedicated tool called a database.



> üí° Well, how & why databases are better; ‚Äú**Pehley istimal karey phir vishvass kare**‚Äù üòÜ (First use it, then trust it),


**MongoDB** is M in ‚Äú**M**ERN‚Äù Stack. It is **open-source**, we can run locally, but cloud version is mostly used, will be continuing with that. Technically, MongoDB is classified as a **NoSQL database**, uses **JSON-like documents** with _optional schemas_.


> üí° SQL database is like storing data in Excel Sheet/Table like format.  
> NoSQL is like storing data in JSON files/documents.


**Terminology :** Analogy to known naming conventions

1. Collection = Table
2. Document = Row

**Example** : `Users` would be a `collection/table` which has `user` in each `row/document`


![Untitled.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dd624914-6876-4b58-9694-424f7aa5e22a/70e4611c-8155-4788-b450-8ea05f294486/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240206T002334Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=62760c07284abc14400fd5e4f005314254ae49c8f9174250d08905f34b92a857&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


> üí° Under the hood, while each document/row is a separate entity within a collection/table, but they are not stored as individual files on the file system. Instead, they are stored together within data files managed by the MongoDB storage engine. So each document/row is individual and together at the same time.


## Database ‚Äì Coding

> Will be learning implementation and code while solving hard exercise in assignment.


Install `mongoose`, another library to make our database connection, CRUD operations easier to code. **Extra nugget**, here our server is interacting with MongoDB, acting as an intermediate but in some apps, frontend directly talks with backend, like in `Firebase`


![Source : Link](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dd624914-6876-4b58-9694-424f7aa5e22a/14b7206e-4c7a-41d6-aa96-36b48de3cffe/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45HZZMZUHI%2F20240206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240206T002334Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=26a77c529e8d7ee77ee8643bd77169f8f325d046c190d1b57837960c86858f60&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


**Schema** is skeleton/structure/layout/blueprint, defines what will be inside that object. In MongoDB, it is optional, but it is good to have to ensure data is consistent. 


> üí° Think of this as a `template` or `signup` form, with all fields mandatory. Whenever data to be pushed, all fields must be intact or filled.


```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: {type: String}, // is equivalent to String 
  password: String, // Types can String, Number, Boolean etc.
  purchasedCourses: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Course' }] // reference
});
```


> ‚ö†Ô∏è In Mongoose, the default behaviour is not to enforce strict schema validation during the save operation. To achieve use, the `required: true`


```javascript
const adminSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
});
```


**Models** is equivalent to creating collections.


```javascript
const Users = mongoose.model('Users', userSchema)
// 'Users' inside the model function, is the name of collection
// need not to be same as variable name.
```


**Connection :** To connect with mongoDB, upon successful connection, collections are automatically created with given Schemas


```javascript
mongoose.connect( "String/DBName", { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
// Second param is optional but recommended to use to avoid errors.
```


**Async/Await** : It is a syntactic sugar on promise, simply another cleaner way to write promises.


```javascript
// This async Looking syntax of Promises

fetch('https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity')
.then(data => data.json())
.then(response => console.log(response.activity))
```


```javascript
// To this sync looking syntax of Promises

async function getActivity(){
  const data = await fetch('https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity');
  const response = await data.json()
  console.log(response.activity)
}

getActivity()
```


**Example** : Saving the new Admin


```javascript
**// Promise Version**

newAdmin.save()
  .then(savedAdmin => {
    console.log(savedAdmin);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('Error:', error);
  });
```


```javascript
**// Async/Await Version**

try {
  const savedAdmin = await newAdmin.save();
  console.log(savedAdmin);
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Error:', error);
}
```


> üí° An Async Syntax that looks like Sync Syntax. That‚Äôs all.   
> Note, it is just syntactic sugar, doesn‚Äôt block the thread, works the exact same way.

**Important Mongoose Functions**


`save()` : To save the object to the collection.


```javascript
const newAdmin = new Admins(obj);
newAdmin.save();
await newAdmin.save(); // another version
```


`find({})` : To get all the documents from a collection.


```javascript
const courses = await Courses.find({});
```


`findOne({...})` : To find an object with these properties corresponding value, if doesn‚Äôt exist returns `null(falsy)`


```javascript
const admin = await Admins.findOne({ username });
```


`findByIdAndUpdate` : Self -Explanatory, to find a document in the collection by its **`_id`** field and update it. Note that the id is the unique id generated by MongoDB


```javascript
const course = await Courses.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.courseId, req.body, { new: true });
```


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **`{ new: true }`**: This is an option passed to the **`findByIdAndUpdate`** method. Setting **`new`** to **`true`** ensures that the updated document is returned as the result of the operation. By default, the method returns the original document before the update.


`findById` : To find a document in a collection based on its unique **`_id`** field.


```javascript
const course = await Course.findById(req.params.courseId);
```


`populate(thatProperty)` : to populate/fill the references to other documents.


```javascript
const user = await User.findOne({ username: req.user.username }).populate('purchasedCourses');
```
