> ðŸ’¡ Things to follow and keep in mind.

1. **Goal**, my 2-3 years experience = your starting point.
2. **Focus** on fundamentals, even ChatGPT can code.
3. **Cut the noise**, Layoffs/ChatGPT.
4. **Fail**, but fail fast and better.
5. **Donâ€™t take break**, stopping is only sin.
6. **Donâ€™t fear**, Race is with yourself.
7. **Get Stuck**, follow Recordings, Sub Group, ChatGPT, TAs.
8. **Donâ€™t leave things**, Motivation comes and goes, but discipline is important.
9. **Position yourself**, position yourself, so we can take advantage of Bull Run and Bear Run.
10. **Strength > Speed**, Think long term, not short term. Donâ€™t trade for money, sharpen the axe.
